#PAYGATE APP

<p>
    I made a real connection with stripe, so i hope thats not problem, but this was my first time working with something like this.

    I want to apologize, that i cant resolve some tasks from assignment.
    I had some problem with:

    -DTO, thats my personal disappointment, bcs when i read about it, i told myself that is easy. It was just some syntax problem, i couldnt resolve how to get collection of related user in DTO. I use package Spatie Data for DTO. It was working, but not perfectly, so i did not use DTO.

    -signature request. I solved it, but in the end i realized you did not mean url Signature, but real signature. And finally i am not use it, bcs its not work with stripe, so... If so, i can rebuild it, but for now, i do not have a time, bcs tomorrow i travel to Prague for weekend. I can do it next week.

    - and i do not use queue, job, service provider and abstraction, i can use it, but for this example i dont know what for, honestly. If you can give me some hint, i will do it.
